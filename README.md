## 1. Define Requirements

### User Stories:
- Customers scan the QR code at their table to access the menu.
- Customers can place orders directly through the website.
- Staff can view and manage orders in real-time.

### Functional Requirements:
- Generate unique QR codes for each table.
- Display menu items and allow customization (e.g., quantity, special requests).
- A simple checkout process (order summary, payment options).
- Admin interface for managing menu items and viewing orders.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Mobile responsiveness.
- Fast loading times.
- Secure handling of customer data.

## 2. Choose Technology Stack
- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (possibly using frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular for interactivity).
- *Backend*: Node.js with Express for server-side handling, MongoDB for database (to store orders, menu items, and table information).
- *QR Code Generation*: Libraries like qrcode in Node.js or QR code APIs.

---

## 3. Database Schema

- *Tables Collection*:
  - tableId
  - qrCode (URL link to order page)

- *Menu Collection*:
  - itemId
  - itemName
  - description
  - price
  - available (boolean)

- *Orders Collection*:
  - orderId
  - tableId
  - items (array of item IDs with quantities)
  - status (pending, completed, etc.)

## 4. Design the UI

- *Homepage*: 
  - Brief instructions on how to use the QR code.

- *Menu Page*: 
  - Display items in a grid or list, with images and prices.
  - Include “Add to Order” buttons for each item.

- *Order Summary Page*: 
  - Show selected items, quantities, total price, and a checkout button.

- *Admin Interface*: 
  - Allow adding/editing menu items and viewing orders.

## 5. Generate QR Codes

- When a new table is created, generate a unique QR code that links to the menu page for that specific table. Use a library like qrcode in your backend.

---

## 6. Implement Payment Processing

- Integrate a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal to handle transactions securely.

---

## 7. Test the Application

- Perform usability testing to ensure customers can easily place orders without interruptions.
- Test across various devices to ensure responsiveness.

---

## 8. Deploy the Website

- Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) to deploy your application.
- Ensure proper domain configuration and SSL for secure transactions.

---

## 9. Monitor and Improve

- Collect feedback from users and staff to improve the system.
- Regularly update the menu and handle any issues that arise.

---

## Additional Considerations

- *User Authentication*: Depending on your requirements, you might want to implement user accounts for customers to track orders.
- *Analytics*: Consider integrating analytics to track order patterns and popular items.
